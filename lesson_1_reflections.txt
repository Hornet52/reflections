How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	Using a diff allowed me to narrow the scope of my search from over 1,000 lines
	of code to just a dozen.
	
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more 
efficient programmer in the long term?

	Having access to previous versions of files would allow for quick reimplementation 
	of past code, or could be used to quickly revert to a known good version.
	
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a 
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
	
	While automatically saving ensures that there is at lease some verison history,
	manual saves or commits allow the user to choose much more logical save points.
	
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files
in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	Different use cases require different versioning methods.
	
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	Using the command 'git log' will bring up a history of all the commits on a 
	project. You can then use 'git diff' to compare two commits.
